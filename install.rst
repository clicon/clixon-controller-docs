::
   
  cd clixon-controller
  ./configure

To make the controller the default clixon application::

  cp /usr/local/etc/clixon/controller.xml /usr/local/etc/clixon/clixon.xml

Configure options
=================
The Controller `configure` script (generated by autoconf) includes several options apart from the standard ones.

These include (standard options are omitted)
  --enable-debug              Build with debug symbols, default: no
  --with-cligen=dir           Use CLIGEN here
  --with-clixon=dir           Use Clixon here
  --with-yang-installdir=DIR  Install Yang files here (default: ${prefix}/share/clixon/controller)
  --with-clicon-user=user     Run as this user in example and test
  --with-clicon-group=group   Run as this group in example and test

Python install
==============
Install the python code by copy::

  sudo cp clixon_server.py /usr/local/bin/

Add a new clicon user and install the needed Python packages,
the backend will start the Python server and drop the privileges
to this user::

  sudo useradd -g clicon -m clicon
